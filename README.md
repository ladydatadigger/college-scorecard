Transformation: 
College score card dataset had 7058 rows and 1977 columns. For our project we pick the following columns to create our SQL database. 'Institution', 'City', 'State Abbreviation', 'ZIP', 'Admissions Rate', 'Tuition In-State', 'Tuition Out-of-State', 'Mean Earnings Post-10 Years', 'Median Earnings Post-10 Years','Median Debt for Post-grads', 'Online','Median Household Income in ZIP', 'Mean Household Income in ZIP','Rental Prices in ZIP'. The dataset was provided as a CSV file. 

Using the 2019 Accredited Online Colleges & Schools website we scraped the website to get a specific table identifying all accredited schools that are online. Although the College Score Card dataset was detailed, it included information  distinguishing a school as ONLY ONLINE, we wanted our dataset to also identify if the college had both online and campus programs. We converted our scraped data into a dataframe with an "Online" column set to all true, then we did a left join to merge the online school data to our main dataset. To merge this dataset with the College Score Card we changed the School name to a string with no special characters and joined the two files. We them set all the NaN values on the "Online" column to False as these were the schools that did not have a match with our list of accredited online schools.

On our College Score Card dataset, the zipcodes were not consistent and would sometimes be in a five-digit format and sometimes include the +4 so first we had to splice the zipcodes so that it would only be in the five-digit format, then we could merge based on zipcode. Using the  Rental Rates Mean csv file, we used the zip code to join our tables to gather information about the means rental rate of the particular neighborhood where the campus school was located. This would help students when looking for rental apartments to plan for what they would pay to live in the campus neighborhood, if not living in dorms. 

We also found a csv file on the neighborhood incomes. We used the zip code to join our tables as well. We wanted to note the actual household income of the neighborhoods within the campus zip code. The College Score Core data included student incomes but did not  indicate the mean and median incomes of the city of the college campus. 

Finally, we did some further cleaning of the data, getting rid of "PrivacySurpressed" values and replacing them with NaN. Then we dropped all the NaN values which condensed our database by getting rid of a lot of the smaller colleges with no zipcode data. We then changed the values of some of the columns from strings into numeric values by dropping special characters first then using to_numeric to convert the data type.

We decided to use the SQL database (relational). We didn't really have a need for a flexible database like MongoDB since the initial dataset the College Scorecard, is in a table structure. Using MongoDB would also require us to declare the columns every time we added a value which would have been time consuming. So, we also found it easier to create a relational database to further join other dataset information. 

* The final tables used in the production database. "Institution", "City", "State Abbreviation", ":"Admissions Rate", "Tuition In-State", "Tuition Out-of-State", "Mean Earnings Post-10 Years", "Median Earnings Post-10 Years", "Median Debt for Post-grads", "Online", "Median Household Income in ZIP", "Mean Household Income in ZIP", and "Rental Prices in ZIP"
